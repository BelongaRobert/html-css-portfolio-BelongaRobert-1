    <body> <p>Hello stranger! My name is Robert and I am currently a student at Momentum. I managed a Domino's Pizza before this but coding has something that has been on my mind. I began attempting to try to learn how to code video games but no avail. Then my wonderful fiancee had persuaded me to go through the program that she had just undergone. I looked into it and spoke with the faculty and I can say i am a proud student of this great school. I am a dual citizen of the US and the country I was born in, Ecuador; thus my bilingualism as well.
        I dont believe in social media so if you would like to get in contact with me, please reach out via Email (BelongaRobert@gmail.com) or reach out over <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-belonga-9889301b1/">linkedin</a> </p>
