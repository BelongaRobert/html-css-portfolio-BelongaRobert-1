           <p>This is a website was the second assignment and it really showed and emphasized on Flexbox. It was a great challenge for me to have to design and set up the website as to the needed format. Being able to overcome my lack there of creativity by creating my own elements in the code and in the final product itself. Once again, very basic code but a fun learning process.</p>

           <p><b>BEHOLD</b> The Lazy River Nursey (Mock) website! This was my first assignment, simple yet still complicated for someone with no experience or prior knowledge. I pull myself up by my bootstraps and pressed on and found out that there really isnt much to it. With just continuous practice and continued direction, I saw the final product before you. It was a very accomplishing and rewarding feeling and now I have the hunger to learn more.</p>
